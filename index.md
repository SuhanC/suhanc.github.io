## About Me

I want to decode disease mechanisms using computational methods for human health progress. I'm passionate about advancing bioinformatics and developing treatments to benefit individuals with limited treatment options. I believe in personalized treatment strategies and aim to contribute to this field.

My previous research involves developing early cancer recurrence detection methods with cfDNA-seq, using machine learning and gene regulatory network to identify targets for metastatic cancers, mostly cancer genomics projects.

Currently, I'm working in Basgenbio Inc., creating drug repurposing algorithms with GWAS and Mendelian randomization.

I'm running my personal [Blog](http://suhansreisen.com/) for few years now. Come and see!

## Research Interests

- **Bioinformatics:** scRNA-seq, Spatial Transcriptomics, Systems Biology, Network Biology
