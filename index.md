## About Me

I want to decode disease mechanisms using computational methods for human health progress. I'm passionate about advancing bioinformatics and developing treatments to benefit individuals with limited treatment options. I believe in personalized treatment strategies and aim to contribute to this field.

My previous research involves developing early cancer recurrence detection methods with cfDNA-seq, using machine learning and gene regulatory network to identify targets for metastatic cancers, mostly cancer genomics projects.

Currently, I'm a Ph.D Student in Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, engaged in reasearch region of psychiatric disorders using multi-modal bioinformatic datasets.

I'm running my personal [Blog](http://suhansreisen.com/) for few years now. Come and see!
